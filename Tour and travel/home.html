                Apple will inform users about the increased prices through email, a notification and in-app messages. Users will only have to act if they do not wish to continue the subscription.
                Users will still be able to cancel their subscriptions if they are not okay with the increased prices. The new subscription policy has no effect on the user’s ability to view, manage and cancel subscriptions.
                Do note that if the above conditions are not satisfied, the consent of the user will be required to auto-renew the subscription at increased prices.
                We feel it would have been better to allow users to opt-in for the new subscription policy as some users might miss the notifications about increased prices sent by Apple and end up paying more than what they agreed to while starting the subscription.
